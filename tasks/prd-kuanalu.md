# Product Requirements Document: TaskFlow - Jira-like Task Management Application

## 1. Introduction/Overview

TaskFlow is a comprehensive task management application modeled after Jira, designed to help organizations manage projects and tasks using a Kanban board structure. The application will allow teams to create, assign, and track tasks across different projects within an organization. The primary goal is to provide a streamlined, intuitive interface for task management with multiple views and detailed task information.

## 2. Goals

- Create a full-featured task management system with Kanban board visualization
- Support organization-level management with multiple projects and users
- Provide multiple views for tasks (Kanban board, list view, calendar view)
- Enable detailed task management with subtasks and comments
- Implement role-based access control for different user types
- Deliver email notifications for task assignments and updates

## 3. User Stories

- As an organization admin, I want to create projects and add team members so that we can collaborate effectively.
- As a project manager, I want to create and assign tasks to team members so that work is distributed appropriately.
- As a team member, I want to view my assigned tasks in different formats (board, list, calendar) so that I can plan my work effectively.
- As a team member, I want to update the status of my tasks so that everyone knows the progress.
- As a team member, I want to add comments to tasks so that I can provide updates and ask questions.
- As a team member, I want to create subtasks for complex tasks so that I can break down work into manageable pieces.
- As a user, I want to receive email notifications when tasks are assigned to me or updated so that I stay informed.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management

1. The system must support user registration and authentication
2. The system must support different user roles (admin, member, etc.)
3. The system must allow organization creation and management
4. The system must enable adding users to organizations with specific roles

### Project Management

5. The system must allow creating multiple projects within an organization
6. The system must provide a project sidebar/navigation for quick access to projects
7. The system must support project settings and configuration

### Task Board

8. The system must provide a Kanban board with 5 columns: Todo, Today, Doing, Blocked, Done
9. The system must allow drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns
10. The system must display task cards with key information (title, assignee, priority)
11. The system must allow filtering and sorting tasks on the board

### Task Management

12. The system must allow creating tasks with title, description, assignee, priority, and due date
13. The system must provide a detailed task view page with all task information
14. The system must support adding, editing, and completing subtasks
15. The system must allow adding comments to tasks
16. The system must track task history and changes

### Views
17. The system must provide a list view of tasks with sorting and filtering options
18. The system must provide a calendar view showing tasks by due date
19. The system must allow switching between different views easily

### Notifications
20. The system must send email notifications for task assignments
21. The system must send email notifications for task updates and comments

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Time tracking functionality
- Billing or subscription management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Custom fields for tasks
- Public API for third-party integrations
- Mobile applications (focus on web application first)
- Real-time collaborative editing of task descriptions

## 6. Design Considerations

- The UI should follow a clean, modern design similar to Jira
- The application should be responsive and work on desktop and tablet devices
- The Kanban board should be the primary interface with clear visual indicators for task priority
- Task cards should be compact but informative
- The task detail page should have a two-column layout:
- Left column: Task card, Subtasks card, Comments card
- Right column: Details card, Actions card

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Next.js App Router for routing and server components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Neon Postgres as the database
- Vercel for hosting
- Authentication service (Auth.js, Clerk, or similar)
- Email service for notifications

### Database Schema Considerations

- Organizations table
- Users table with role information
- Projects table
- Tasks table with status, priority, etc.
- Subtasks table
- Comments table
- User-Organization relationships
- User-Project relationships

## 8. Success Metrics

- User adoption: 80% of team members actively using the platform
- Task management efficiency: Reduced time to update and track tasks
- Collaboration: Increased comment activity and task updates
- Project visibility: Improved awareness of project status and bottlenecks

## 9. Open Questions

- What authentication provider will be used? (Auth.js, Clerk, etc.)
- Will there be any limits on the number of projects, tasks, or users?
- Are there any specific email notification templates or frequency controls needed?
- Should tasks support file attachments?
- Is there a need for task templates or recurring tasks?

This PRD provides a foundation for developing your TaskFlow application. The next steps would be to create wireframes, set up the project structure, and begin implementing the core functionality.
